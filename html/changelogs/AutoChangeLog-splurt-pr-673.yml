changes:
  - balance: "Effects from Hexacrocin OD now increase in strength as it progresses rather than hitting all at once when certain thresholds were reached (i.e. 120 stress gives you 10 seconds of blurred vision rather than 20)"
  - rscdel: "Removed Oxyloss and Hallucinations from Hexacrocin OD"
  - bugfix: "Hexacrocin OD messages maintain consistent levels of urgency as they progress"
  - code_imp: "Added `adjust_minimum_arousal` proc"
